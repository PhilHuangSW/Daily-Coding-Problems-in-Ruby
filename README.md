## Problem #533 [Easy]

This problem was asked by **Facebook**.

Boggle is a game played on a 4 x 4 grid of letters. The goal is to find as many words as possible that can be formed by a sequence of adjacent letters in the grid, using each cell at most once. Given a game board and a dictionary of valid words, implement a Boggle solver.

## Problem #534 [Easy]

This problem was asked by **Amazon**.

Given a string, determine whether any permutation of it is a palindrome.

For example, carrace should return true, since it can be rearranged to form racecar, which is a palindrome. daily should return false, since there's no rearrangement that can form a palindrome.

## Problem #537 [Easy]

This problem was asked by **Apple**.

A Collatz sequence in mathematics can be defined as follows. Starting with any positive integer:

- if n is even, the next number in the sequence is n / 2
- if n is odd, the next number in the sequence is 3n + 1

It is conjectured that every such sequence eventually reaches the number 1. Test this conjecture.

Bonus: What input n <= 1000000 gives the longest sequence?

## Problem #531 [Easy]

This problem was asked **Microsoft**.

Using a read7() method that returns 7 characters from a file, implement readN(n) which reads n characters.

For example, given a file with the content “Hello world”, three read7() returns “Hello w”, “orld” and then “”.

## Problem #546 [Medium]

This problem was asked by **Google**.

Given an array of integers, return a new array where each element in the new array is the number of smaller elements to the right of that element in the original input array.

For example, given the array [3, 4, 9, 6, 1], return [1, 1, 2, 1, 0], since:

- There is 1 smaller element to the right of 3
- There is 1 smaller element to the right of 4
- There are 2 smaller elements to the right of 9
- There is 1 smaller element to the right of 6
- There are no smaller elements to the right of 1

## Problem #544 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Google.

Given a list of integers S and a target number k, write a function that returns a subset of S that adds up to k. If such a subset cannot be made, then return null.

Integers can appear more than once in the list. You may assume all numbers in the list are positive.

For example, given S = [12, 1, 61, 5, 9, 2] and k = 24, return [12, 9, 2, 1] since it sums up to 24.
