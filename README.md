## Problem 533

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Boggle is a game played on a 4 x 4 grid of letters. The goal is to find as many words as possible that can be formed by a sequence of adjacent letters in the grid, using each cell at most once. Given a game board and a dictionary of valid words, implement a Boggle solver.

## Problem 534

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given a string, determine whether any permutation of it is a palindrome.

For example, carrace should return true, since it can be rearranged to form racecar, which is a palindrome. daily should return false, since there's no rearrangement that can form a palindrome.

## Problem 537

This problem was asked by Apple.

A Collatz sequence in mathematics can be defined as follows. Starting with any positive integer:

- if n is even, the next number in the sequence is n / 2
- if n is odd, the next number in the sequence is 3n + 1

It is conjectured that every such sequence eventually reaches the number 1. Test this conjecture.

Bonus: What input n <= 1000000 gives the longest sequence?

## Problem 531

This problem was asked Microsoft.

Using a read7() method that returns 7 characters from a file, implement readN(n) which reads n characters.

For example, given a file with the content “Hello world”, three read7() returns “Hello w”, “orld” and then “”.
